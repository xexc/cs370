In this project, I developed an intelligent agent for a treasure hunt game where the agent represents a pirate. The goal of the pirate agent is to find the treasure before the human player by navigating a game world that includes various pathways and obstacles. This problem was framed as a pathfinding challenge, which I addressed using reinforcement learning, specifically deep Q-learning.


I implemented the deep Q-learning algorithm using a neural network. This involved creating the Q-network architecture, defining the action-selection policy, implementing the experience replay mechanism, and writing the training loop where the agent interacts with the environment, receives rewards, updates its Q-values, and learns over time.


What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
In this project, I applied key concepts from artificial intelligence, such as reinforcement learning and neural networks, to develop an intelligent agent capable of autonomous decision-making. This showcases the broader role of computer science in developing technologies that can perform tasks intelligently, making our lives more convenient.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist, I approach problems systematically by breaking them down into smaller, manageable components. I analyze the problem requirements, choose appropriate algorithms and data structures, and iteratively develop and test my solution. 

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibilities include ensuring that the solutions I develop are secure, unbiased, and respect user privacy. In the context of the pirate intelligent agent, it is important to ensure that the AI behaves fairly and does not exploit any unintended flaws in the game environment that could result in an unfair advantage.
